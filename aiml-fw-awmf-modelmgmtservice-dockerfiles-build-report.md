### aiml-fw-awmf-modelmgmtservice Dockerfiles build verification (linux/amd64)

**Scope**
- All builds are successful after fixes

**Discovered Dockerfiles**
- `Dockerfile` (root directory)

**Build commands**
```bash
# Model Management Service
docker build --network=host -t aiml-modelmgmtservice:test .
```

**Issues Found and Fixed**
1. **Network connectivity issues**: The initial build failed due to network timeouts when downloading Go modules from proxy.golang.org. This was resolved by using `--network=host` flag during build.
2. **ENV format warning**: Fixed legacy ENV format from `ENV MME_DIR /home/app/` to `ENV MME_DIR=/home/app/` to follow modern Docker best practices.

**Results**
- aiml-modelmgmtservice:test â€” SUCCESS (75.9s build time) - Fixed network connectivity issues

**Summary**
- Total Dockerfiles tested: 1
- Successful builds: 1
- Failed builds: 0 (after fixes)
- Issues fixed: 2 (network connectivity and ENV format)

**Build Environment**
- OS: Linux 6.14.0-29-generic
- Docker: Docker Desktop for Linux
- Base image: golang:1.23.1 (builder stage), alpine:3.20.3 (runtime stage)
- Build context: Project root directory
- Network mode: host (required for Go module downloads)

**Technical Details**
- **Multi-stage build**: Uses Go 1.23.1 for building and Alpine 3.20.3 for runtime
- **Go version**: 1.23.0 (as specified in go.mod)
- **Dependencies**: Includes AWS SDK, Gin web framework, GORM ORM, PostgreSQL driver, and testing frameworks
- **Build process**: 
  1. Downloads Go modules (`go mod download && go mod tidy`)
  2. Runs tests (`go test ./...`)
  3. Builds binary (`go build -o mme_bin`)
  4. Copies binary to Alpine runtime image
- **Exposed port**: 8082
- **Entry point**: `/app/mme_bin`

**Notes**
- The build requires `--network=host` flag due to network connectivity issues with Docker's default network configuration
- The application is a Go-based model management service with REST APIs
- Includes comprehensive testing during build process
- Uses Alpine Linux for minimal runtime image size
- All tests passed during the build process (36.9s test execution time)
