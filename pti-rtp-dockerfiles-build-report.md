### pti-rtp Dockerfiles build verification (linux/amd64)

**Scope**
- Repository analysis for Docker-related files and build capabilities

**Repository Information**
- **Source**: [GitHub - o-ran-sc/pti-rtp](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/pti-rtp)
- **Language distribution**: Shell 71.3%, Jinja 17.6%, BitBake 11.1%
- **License**: Apache-2.0
- **Project type**: Performance Tuned Infrastructure - Yocto/OpenEmbedded layers and OKD deployment automation

**Discovered Docker-related Files**
- `scripts/build_inf_debian/meta-patches-arm/stx9.0/stx-tools/0003-dockerfiles-add-stx-lat-tool_arm64.Dockerfile.patch`
- `scripts/build_inf_debian/meta-patches-arm/stx10.0/stx-tools/0003-dockerfiles-add-stx-lat-tool_arm64.Dockerfile.patch`
- `okd/roles/setup_http_store/tasks/container.yml` (Ansible playbook for container management)

**Analysis Results**
- **Total Dockerfiles found**: 0 (no actual Dockerfiles present)
- **Docker-related files found**: 3 (2 patch files, 1 Ansible playbook)
- **Build capability**: No direct Docker build capability

**Docker-related Content Analysis**

**1. Dockerfile Patch Files**
- **Location**: `scripts/build_inf_debian/meta-patches-arm/stx*/stx-tools/`
- **Content**: Git patch files containing Dockerfile definitions for ARM64 architecture
- **Purpose**: These patches would be applied to other repositories to add ARM64 support for StarlingX LAT (Linux Application Toolkit) tools
- **Dockerfile Content**: 
  - Base image: `debian:bullseye`
  - Purpose: LAT SDK container for ARM64 architecture
  - Features: Python 3, SSH client, development tools, LAT SDK installation
  - Architecture-specific modifications: x86_64 → aarch64, corei7-64 → cortexa57

**2. Container Management (Ansible)**
- **Location**: `okd/roles/setup_http_store/tasks/container.yml`
- **Content**: Ansible playbook for managing Podman containers
- **Purpose**: Deploy HTTP store container for OKD installation media
- **Container operations**: Create pods, manage containers, systemd service integration

```

**Project Purpose**
This repository is designed for:
1. **Yocto/OpenEmbedded Integration**: Building custom Linux systems for embedded/IoT products
2. **OKD Deployment**: Automated deployment of O-Cloud instances using OKD (OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution)
3. **Performance Tuned Infrastructure**: Reference platform for O-RAN-SC components
4. **Multi-architecture Support**: ARM64 patches for StarlingX tools

**Container Usage**
- **Primary**: Ansible-managed Podman containers for OKD deployment infrastructure
- **Secondary**: Dockerfile patches for cross-architecture tool support
- **No direct Docker builds**: Repository doesn't contain buildable Dockerfiles

**Technical Details**
- **Base Images**: Debian Bullseye (in patch files)
- **Container Runtime**: Podman (for OKD deployment)
- **Architecture Support**: x86_64, ARM64 (via patches)
- **Build System**: Yocto/OpenEmbedded, Ansible
- **Target Platform**: O-RAN-SC Performance Tuned Infrastructure

**Notes**
- This repository does not contain actual Dockerfiles for direct Docker builds
- The Docker-related content consists of patch files that would be applied to other repositories
- Container usage is primarily for OKD deployment automation via Ansible
- The repository focuses on Yocto/OpenEmbedded build systems rather than containerization
- ARM64 support is provided through patch files for StarlingX LAT tools

**Recommendations**
- No Docker build fixes needed as no buildable Dockerfiles are present
- Repository serves its intended purpose for Yocto/OpenEmbedded and OKD deployment
- Docker-related patches are properly structured for application to target repositories
- Container management via Ansible is appropriate for the deployment automation use case

**Project Context**
- This repository is a mirror of the upstream Gerrit repo for O-RAN-SC Performance Tuned Infrastructure
- Contains deployment scripts, Yocto layers, and configuration files for RIC platform components
- Supports both Yocto-based system builds and OKD-based O-Cloud deployment
- Integrates with O-RAN-SC Non-RT RIC architecture and StarlingX platform components
- Provides cross-architecture support through patch-based modifications

**Conclusion**
The pti-rtp repository does not contain buildable Dockerfiles and therefore does not require Docker build testing or fixes. The repository serves its intended purpose for Yocto/OpenEmbedded system builds and OKD deployment automation, with appropriate container usage for deployment infrastructure management.
